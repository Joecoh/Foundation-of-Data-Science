 CS3361 Data Science Laboratory Welcome to my repository for the CS3361 Data Science Laboratory course. This repository contains all the experiments, code, and resources related to the course objectives.  Course Objectives: Gain proficiency in Python libraries essential for data science such as NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Jupyter, and Statsmodels. Understand and apply basic statistical and probability measures in data science. Perform descriptive analytics on benchmark datasets. Conduct correlation and regression analytics on standard datasets. Present and interpret data using various visualization packages in Python. List of Experiments: Setup and Exploration: Install and explore the features of NumPy, SciPy, Jupyter, Statsmodels, and Pandas. Numpy Arrays: Work with NumPy arrays to perform various operations. Pandas DataFrames: Manipulate and analyze data using Pandas DataFrames. Data Handling: Read data from text files, Excel, and the web. Perform descriptive analytics on the Iris dataset. Statistical Analysis: Perform univariate, bivariate, and multiple regression analysis on the UCI Diabetes and Pima Indians Diabetes datasets. Compare results across datasets. Data Visualization: Apply various plotting functions on UCI datasets, including: Normal curves Density and contour plots Correlation and scatter plots Histograms 3D plotting Geographic Data Visualization: Visualize geographic data using Basemap.
